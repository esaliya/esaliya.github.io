    tl;dr - Use [Dillinger](dillinger.io) and paste the formatted content directly to blogger

Recently, I tried many techinques, which will allow me to write blogs in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The available choice in broad categories are,

- Use makrdown aware static blog generator such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or something based on it like [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
- Use a blogging solution based on markdown such as [svbtle](http://svbtle.com)
- Use a tool that'll either enable markdown support in blogger (see this [post](http://dvdotsenko.blogspot.com/2012/08/markdown-with-blogspotcom-and-bloggercom.html)) or can post to blogger (like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/))

First is the obvious choice if you need total control over your blog, but I didn't want to get into too much trouble just to blog because it involes hosting the generated static html pages on your own - not to mention the trouble of enabling comments. I like the second solution from and went the distance to even move my blog to svbtle. It's pretty simple and straightforward, but after doing a post or two I realized the lack of comments is a showstopper. I agree it's good for posts intended for "read only" use, but usually it's not the case for me.

This is when I started investigating on the third option and thought StackEdit to be a nice solution as it'll allow posting to blogger directly. However, it doesn't support syntax highlighting for code blocks - bummer!

Then came the "aha!" moment. I've been using Dillinger to edit markdown regularly as it's very simple and gives you instant formatted output. I thought why not just copy the formatted content and paste it in the blog post - duh. No surprises - it worked like a charm. Dillinger beatifully formats everything including syntax highligting for code/scripts. Also, it allows you to link with either Dropbox or Github where I use Github. 

All in all, I found Dillinger to be the easiest solution and if you like to see a formatted post see my first [post](http://esaliya.blogspot.com/2014/08/running-c-mpinet-applications-with-mono.html) with it.
