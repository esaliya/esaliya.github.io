I recently purchases an Intel dual band AC-7260 pcie card to replace the existing wireless adapter in my desktop machine. Here's the amzon link http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Wireless-Bluetooth-Desktops-7260HMWDTX1h-R/dp/B00X68U0SU.

I installed the updated drivers from Intel using their driver udpate utility and all seemed to work fine, until I checked for speed. It was too low. After googling a bit I found this is known to be a case with this card. Then came across this nice blog post (http://blog.benkonicek.com/2014/10/24/fixing-the-intel-wireless-n-7260-connection-issues/) that pointed to some older drivers and they worked pretty well.
