The ability to refer (pass) methods in Java 8 is a convenient feature, however, as a programmer you might face the situtaion where some code that seemingly follow the correct syntax to refer a method that throws an exception gives a compilation error of an `Unhandled Exception`, which doesn't go away by wrapping the call in a `try/catch` or adding a `throws` clause to the method signature. See the following code,

    import java.util.function.Function;

    public class PassingMethodsThatThrowExceptions {
    
        public static int addOne(String value) throws NotANumberException{
            int v = 0;
            try{
                v = Integer.parseInt(value);
            } catch (NumberFormatException e){
                throw new NotANumberException();
            }
            return v+1;
        }
    
        public static void increment(Function<String, Integer> incrementer, String value){
            System.out.println(incrementer.apply(value));
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            increment(PassingMethodsThatThrowExceptions::addOne, "10");
        }
    }

This is a simple code, which has
- an `addOne` function that takes in a `String` value representing a number then adds `1` to it and returns the result as an `int`. 
- an `increment` function that simply takes a function, which can perform the increment and a value then apply the function to the value.
- the `main` method that calls `increment` with `addOne` function and value `"10"`

Note. `addOne` function is declared to throw possible exception of type `NotANumberException` (the type of exception is NOT important here).

This code will result in following compilation error,
        
        Error: java: incompatible thrown types exceptions.NotANumberException in method reference
        

If you use an IDE such as IntelliJIDEA it'll show `Unhandled Exception: NotANumberException` for the `increment` method call in `main` and adding `try/catch` will not work.

What's going wrong here? It's actually a mistake on your end. 

The `increment` function expects a function that takes a `String` and returns an `int`, but you forgot to mention that this method may also throw an exception of type `NotANumberException`. 

The solution is to correct the type of `incrementer` parameter in `increment` function. 

Note. you'll need to write a new [functional interface](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html) because you can't add `throws NotANumberException` to the `java.util.function.Function` interface that's used to define the type of `incrementer` parameter here.

Here's the working solution in full.

    public class PassingMethodsThatThrowExceptions {
        public interface IncrementerSignature{
            public int apply(String value) throws NotANumberException;
        }
        
        public static int addOne(String value) throws NotANumberException{
            int v = 0;
            try{
                v = Integer.parseInt(value);
            } catch (NumberFormatException e){
                throw new NotANumberException();
            }
            return v+1;
        }
    
        public static void increment(IncrementerSignature incrementer, String value) throws NotANumberException {
            System.out.println(incrementer.apply(value));
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                increment(PassingMethodsThatThrowExceptions::addOne, "10");
            } catch (NotANumberException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

Also, note this is `NOT` something to do with referring methods or Java 8 in general. You may face a similar situation even in a case where you implement a method of an interface and in the implementation you add the `throws SomeException` to the signature. Here's a stackoverflow [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18198176/java-8-lambda-function-that-throws-exception) you'd like to see on this.

Hope this helps!
